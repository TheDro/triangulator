# Triangulator

## Description

This application can be used to convert an image to an array of triangles. Ideally, the location of the vertices of the triangles would optimized automatically but I may end up making a manual process where the user clicks on the image to create vertices.

## How to run

- Install node modules using `npm i`
- Run the parcel server using `npx parcel src/index.html`
